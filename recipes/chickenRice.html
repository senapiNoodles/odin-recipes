<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li>
    <li>
        Heat olive oil a large oven safe pot over medium-high heat (I use a 6 quart enameled pot).
    </li>

    <li>
        Dab thighs dry with paper towels, season both sides with salt and pepper.
    </li>

    <li>
        Place thighs in pot skin side down, leaving space around each thigh. Let cook until slightly browned, about 3 –
        4
        minutes. Turn and continue and cook 2 – 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate.
    </li>

    <li>Drain off most of the fat then return pot to medium-high heat. Add onions, carrots, and celery, saute 3 minutes.
        Add
        garlic and saute 1 minute longer.
    </li>

    <li>Pour in chicken broth and lemon juice and bring mixture to a boil.</li>

    <li>Meanwhile in a small bowl stir together Italian seasoning and paprika. Season both sides of chicken with
        seasoning.</li>

    <li>Add rice into pot once broth reaches a boil, give it a quick stir. Remove from heat, place thighs on top of rice
        mixture. Cover pot with snug fitting oven safe lid.</li>

    <li>Bake chicken and rice in pot until rice is tender and chicken is cooked through, about 35 minutes.</li>

    <li>Remove thighs from rice, add parsley to rice and fluff with a fork. Serve warm.
